R package to support <b>Remote Sensing based Crop Mapping</b>. It was developed at the University of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, as part of the project Research Network Water in Central Asia (<a href="http://www.cawa-project.net/">CAWa</a>) funded by the German Federal Foreign Office. It is part of the German Water Initiative for Central Asia (the so-called <a href="http://waterca.org/en/the-berlin-process/">Berlin process</a>), which the <a href="https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en">German Federal Foreign Office</a> launched on the 1<sup>st</sup> of April of 2008 to support peaceful, sustainable and mutually beneficial management of transboundary water resources in Central Asia. `CAWaR` was designed to support water management in Central Asia by supporting the distinction and mapping of crops. As different crops have different water use requirements, knowing their spatial and temporal distribution helps decision makers build efficient water distribution practices in periods of water scarcity. In the context of climiate change, arid environments such as the one found in Central Asia makes efficient management practices a pressing requirement and toolboxes such as `CAWaR` make the work of local authorities much easier and consistent. `CAWaR` offers tools for:
</p>
* Checking of the consistency of ground-truth data.

* Extraction of time-series from ground-truth data.

* Build-up of reference time series for target crops.

* Splitting of training and validation samples.

* Phenology based classification of crop types.

* Spatially explicit validation of map accuracy.

* Identification of poor quality samples based on validation results.
